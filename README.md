# Chat-with-Data

## About the Project
An advanced AI-driven web application designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate fraudulent activities in real-time. The system leverages LLM to identify suspicious patterns and anomalies, enhancing fraud detection accuracy. It also incorporates reinforcement learning capabilities, allowing the platform to continuously learn and adapt to emerging fraud tactics, thereby improving detection over time. 

For this project, we will be using sample fraud transaction data from MySQL and we can find the fraudulent activities in real-time.
